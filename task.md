# Task Tracker

Status derived from `plan.md` and current implementation.

## ‚úÖ Done / Working

- [x] Core site analysis workflow (`src/lib/analysis-service.ts`)
  - Fetch page HTML via browser service (or HTTP fallback)
  - AI-powered page analysis and LYTX recommendation generation
  - Robust JSON extraction/parsing from model output
  - Detailed logging across steps
- [x] Cloudflare Browser Service with fallback (`src/lib/browser-service.ts`)
  - Puppeteer-in-Workers support (behind `env.MYBROWSER` binding)
  - Fallback HTTP fetch with retries and rotated user-agents
  - Basic bot-protection heuristics
- [x] API endpoint: POST `/api/analyze` (`src/api/analyze.ts`)
- [x] UI to submit URL and render results (`src/components/HomePage.tsx`)
- [x] App shell and routing (`src/worker.tsx`, `src/Document.tsx`)
- [x] Public assets wired (manifest + icons under `public/`)
- [x] Build/dev scripts in `package.json`; project builds successfully

## üü® Partial / Needs follow-up

- [~] KV caching hooks present in browser service, but KV binding not configured in `wrangler.jsonc`
- [~] Puppeteer binding (`env.MYBROWSER`) referenced but not configured for local/dev by default
- [~] Zod schemas exist for outputs (`src/lib/types.ts`) but not used to validate parsing at runtime
- [~] Bot protection handling present; could add alternative strategies and heuristics
- [~] Logging is comprehensive, but no centralized logger/levels/structured sink

## ‚õèÔ∏è To Do (from plan, not yet implemented)

- [ ] Cloudflare bindings configuration in `wrangler.jsonc`
  - [ ] `MYBROWSER` (Browser Rendering)
  - [ ] `SITE_ANALYSIS_CACHE` (KV namespace)
  - [ ] D1 database binding for persistence
- [ ] Persistence
  - [ ] Create D1 schema and migrations (see plan.md example)
  - [ ] Store analysis results; add fetch/list endpoints
  - [ ] Add TTL-based KV caching for analysis responses
- [ ] LYTX Integration Module
  - [ ] Implement official LYTX API client (auth/config)
  - [ ] Replace heuristic recs with API-backed intelligence where applicable
  - [ ] Add testing stubs/mocks for LYTX client
- [ ] AI SDK v5 advanced usage
  - [ ] Replace free-form `generateText` with tool-calling/structured outputs
  - [ ] Validate with Zod at runtime (`safeParse`) and re-prompt on invalid
  - [ ] Consider streaming/partial responses if beneficial
- [ ] Keyword Research & Marketing Strategy
  - [ ] Implement keyword research tool (see plan section 8)
  - [ ] Implement marketing strategy generation (plan section 9)
  - [ ] UI tabs for keyword/strategy results
- [ ] API & UI Enhancements
  - [ ] Expose screenshot option via API and UI
  - [ ] Add URL validation and sanitization; block unsupported protocols
  - [ ] Improve error surfaces and retry suggestions in UI
- [ ] Testing Strategy
  - [ ] Unit tests: JSON extraction, bot detection, parsers
  - [ ] Integration tests: `/api/analyze` happy/failure paths
  - [ ] E2E: submit URL and render results
  - [ ] Performance tests for concurrent analyses
- [ ] Observability & Ops
  - [ ] Rate limiting per IP
  - [ ] Monitoring/metrics and cost tracking
  - [ ] Centralized structured logging with levels
- [ ] CI/CD & Release
  - [ ] GitHub Actions (build, test, lint)
  - [ ] Preview deployments
  - [ ] Release flow aligned with `bun run release`
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] README: add binding setup steps, local `.dev.vars` examples
  - [ ] Usage docs for endpoints and environment requirements
- [ ] Nice-to-haves
  - [ ] Playwright integration for complex sites (optional)
  - [ ] Vercel AI Gateway for routing/cost (optional)
  - [ ] Cloudflare Analytics Engine for internal telemetry (optional)
